Matches is always an array- each of the elements in matches have just two
properties: text, par.

In matches, each entry is one line. A line can have more than one
match. I don't know why boxes is an array yet. 

Closer. When it's on the beginning of a line it's perfect. When it's not the
first thing in the line it's one word to the left. (It might be that it's twice
as many words away as it should be- in some quick testing I couldn't get it to
display any of the words on the right side of the sentences at all.)
